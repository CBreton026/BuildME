# BuildME

Framework to calculate building material & energy expenditures.

This model was originally developed by Niko Heeren for the work on the [UNEP IRP report on Ressource Efficiency](https://www.unenvironment.org/resources/report/resource-efficiency-and-climate-change-material-efficiency-strategies-low-carbon).

## Publications

The code was used in the following publications: 

- [UNEP IRP report on Ressource Efficiency](https://www.unenvironment.org/resources/report/resource-efficiency-and-climate-change-material-efficiency-strategies-low-carbon) (commit [c164a07](https://github.com/nheeren/BuildME/commit/c164a0708ceef1aac632a22e585d0edb398e6bc6))
- [Global scenarios of resource and emission savings from material efficiency in residential buildings and cars](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-021-25300-4) (commit [574da69](https://github.com/nheeren/BuildME/commit/574da69aac3724f31c841ffb040f090ed8d036d4))
