# BuildME

Framework to calculate building material & energy expenditures.

## Setup

- Copy the [desired energyplus binaries](https://energyplus.net/downloads) to e.g. `./bin/EnergyPlus-9-0-1`
- Correct the paths in `BuildME/settings.py`

The current version should work on macOS, probably Linux, and will need some adaptations for Windows, such as renaming executable names, etc.
